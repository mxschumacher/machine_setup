1. go to https://www.archlinux.org/download/
2. download the archlinux.iso, preferably through a torrent (Transmission can be used as a client)
3. download the signature for the .iso --> archlinux-<version>-x86_64.iso.sig, version could be something like "2020.02.01"
4. With both files in the same folder, run:
> gpg --keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve --verify archlinux-2020.02.01-x86_64.iso.sig  

install qemu as a virtual machine

if you just want user mode cpu emulation for X86-64 architecture, you need to use qemu-x86_64 binary and if you need whole X86-64 bit system emulation (like your PC), qemu-system-x86_64 binary must be used in commands below.

Hard disks are divided into partitions and this division is described in the partition table. 

The kernel is the core of an operating system. It functions on a low level (kernelspace) interacting between the hardware
 of the machine and the programs which use the hardware to run. The kernel temporarily stops programs to run other programs 
 in the meantime, which is known as preemption. This creates the illusion of many tasks being executed simultaneously, even on 
 single-core CPUs. The kernel uses the CPU scheduler to decide which program takes priority at any given moment. 

The default Arch Linux kernel is modular, meaning many of the drivers for machine hardware 
reside on the hard drive and are available as modules. At boot, udev takes an inventory of 
your hardware and loads appropriate modules (drivers) for your corresponding hardware, which 
will in turn allow creation of a network interface.
